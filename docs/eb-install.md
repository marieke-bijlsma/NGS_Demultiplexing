# 1\. Install environment

### 1) Get depad-utils and configure environment 

Login to your cluster and navigate to your home folder:

```bash
cd ${HOME}
```
Download and unzip [these files](attachments/depad-utils.zip) **_(There are hidden files/directories)._**

**_Note:_** Make sure that the etc/skel/.bashrc from the zip file was already deployed as root
and that /etc/skel/.bashrc was copied to your home dir when it was created (cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~).
If your .bashrc does not have the contents from the template, you can add it manually and notify an admin to deploy the template in /etc/skel/.

Create a folder where the modules will be installed: 
```bash
mkdir /apps/modules/

### Copy all files in the folder /apps/modules/ from the zip to the server (if /apps/modules is not possible, NB copying these files should go somewhere else)

cp -r depad-utils/apps/modules/* depad-utils/.lmod/ /apps/modules/
```
**_NB: Lmod must already have been deployed as root using your Linux distro's package manager._**
**_NB2: In case /apps/modules is not possible, then ~/.bashrc should also be changed._**

If lmod is not installed, please do the following (admins-only), in our case for CentOS use: 
```
$root>: yum install lmod
```

To verify that /apps/modules/modules.bashrc gets sourced: logout + login.
When ${HPC_ENV_PREFIX} is set, you are good to continue to the next step.

```bash
echo ${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}
```

### 2) Create main folders for our HPC environment.
```bash
mkdir -m 2775 ${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}/data/
mkdir -m 2775 ${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}/software/
mkdir -m 2775 ${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}/sources/
mkdir -m 2770 ${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}/.tmp/
```


### 3) Download EasyBuild bootstrap script
```bash
export EASYBUILD_VERSION=2.8.1
mkdir -p /${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}/sources/EasyBuild/
cd /${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}/sources/EasyBuild
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpcugent/easybuild-framework/develop/easybuild/scripts/bootstrap_eb.py
mv bootstrap_eb.py bootstrap_eb_${EASYBUILD_VERSION}.py
```
### 4) Bootstrap EasyBuild in apps dir.
```bash
python /${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}/sources/EasyBuild/bootstrap_eb_${EASYBUILD_VERSION}.py ${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}
```

### 5) Sanity check

Logout and login again.
```bash
module load EasyBuild
module list
eb --version
```
### 6) Install toolchain
```bash
eb foss-2015b.eb -â€“robot
```

**_Note: Some sources should be downloaded manually_ (see below).**
```bash
scp gcc-4.9.3.tar.bz2 /${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}/sources/g/GCC/
scp gmp-6.0.0a.tar.bz2 /${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}/sources/g/GCC/
scp mpc-1.0.2.tar.gz /${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}/sources/g/GCC/
scp mpfr-3.1.2.tar.gz /${HPC_ENV_PREFIX}/sources/g/GCC/
```
### 7) Installing additional packages

The following packages should be on the cluster/VM (this can only be done with root access):
```bash
yum install libibverbs-devel
yum install openssl-devel
yum install unzip
yum install libX11-devel
yum install libXrender-devel
yum install libXext-devel
yum install mesa-libGL-devel
yum install mesa-libGLU-devel
```

### 8a) Get molgenis-easybuild repo

Now that EasyBuild is installed, we need to get the molgenis easybuild configs. This is because it contains a lot of custom easyconfigs that are  not in the original easybuild repo from Ghent University: [https://github.com/molgenis/easybuild-easyconfigs](https://github.com/molgenis/easybuild-easyconfigs).

There are 2 options:
- Fork this repo to your own repo and then do a git clone (on the cluster, then you can skip 8b)
- Download the latest zip or tar.gz at [https://github.com/molgenis/easybuild-easyconfigs/releases/](https://github.com/molgenis/easybuild-easyconfigs/releases/) (proceed to 8b)

### 8b) Put the new repo on the cluster/VM

```bash
scp -r easybuild-easyconfigs yourusername@yourcluster.nl:${root}/${pathToMYeasybuildconfigs}
```
